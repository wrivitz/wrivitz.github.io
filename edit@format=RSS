This community begins developing from the first week students arrive on campus. Freshmen are quickly whisked off to their <a href="http://orientation.princeton.edu/program/small-group-experiences/">pre-orientation trips</a>, devoting five days and four nights to the wilderness or to surrounding communities. As it currently stands, all incoming students are placed into either an Outdoor Action (OA), Community Action (CA), or Dialogue and Difference in Action (DDA) trip. As of last year the University also introduced an on-campus program for fall athletes who are unable to travel off-campus due to their preseason schedules. These introductions to Princeton provide students with an immediate friend group and set the tone for the following four years. Thus, it is in the interest of the whole Princeton community that pre-orientation trips are engaging and meaningful experiences. Princeton does a great job making the programs successful, but the Board believes some improvements could be made to further improve the trip experience. Namely, we recommend that more spots for OA be available to accommodate greater demand, that electronics be banned on CA and DDA as well as on OA, and that the closing trip activity when students arrive back on campus be brief and uniform across different trips.</p><p>The Board first commends the University for last year instituting a pre-orientation program for fall sport athletes. While fall athletes cannot travel off campus due to their intense preseason schedules, many of the conversations and programming that takes place on the off-campus trips are important for all students to experience. The fall athlete pre-orientation experience is a positive step and helps the University build a more cohesive community among athletes and non-athletes by giving all students a common base of pre-orientation experiences.</p><p>Turning to our recommendations for improvement, while OA tends to be the most popular of the three trip options, it can only take around 700 students due to the supplies and leaders available. This limit necessarily places some students into their second choice of a CA or DDA trip. While the Board recognizes Princeton’s interest in this limit, such as students having a diversity of experiences, as well as the logistics regarding resource allocation, we believe it would be beneficial to increase the number of spots for OA such that more students are able to attend their first choice trip. Increasing the number of OA spots will foster enthusiasm on and devotion to the trips and reinforce the notion of “challenge by choice,” as students are more committed to experiences they select than to those they are assigned. Not only would this change improve the experiences of students who prefer OA and are placed on an OA trip, but it would also improve the experiences of students on CA and DDA, because they would be with other students equally enthusiastic about these trips.</p><p>We recognize that the current restriction of OA spots is due to limited leaders and supplies, but we urge the University community to take any steps it can to increase the number of OA spots available. In 2015, the fees for students to complete OA Leader training were eliminated, which was a great step in making it more accessible for students to become OA leaders. We encourage our fellow students to consider becoming OA leaders and to participate in this important program welcoming new students to Princeton. It is also a worthwhile investment for the University to purchase more supplies such as tents and sleeping bags if that is what it takes to offer more OA slots. This could be facilitated in part by asking students as soon as they matriculate to offer a tentative, nonbinding ranking of their preferred pre-Orientation trips. Currently, the University does not know trip interest levels until incoming students submit their official trip rankings over the summer. Having this information when incoming students matriculate by May would help give the University more time to accommodate any greater demand for OA.</p><p>The Board also strongly encourages that CA and DDA leaders follow the example of their counterparts in OA and prohibit cell phone usage for the duration of the trips. The primary goal of the trips is to facilitate conversations and connections among the incoming class; this goal is inhibited by the use of phones. In OA, students are sent to the wilderness for five days with no phones; this is remarkably successful at fostering camaraderie, in large part because students have no choice but to talk to each other. While CA and DDA trips are generally less remote, the programs should still emulate their outdoor counterpart by collecting students’ phones for those few days to encourage conversations.</p><p>Finally, the Board recommends that all of the trips condense their on-campus programming on Friday night. Students have just spent five days in an immersive and intensive experience, and they should be given the opportunity to embark on their own campus experiences as soon as possible upon return. While the pre-orientation programs tend to conclude with a final reflective experience, some groups do these on the trail or bus ride back to campus, while others do them on campus Friday night. We recommend that all trips conclude uniformly with a post-trip debrief dinner so as to provide students with a positive closing moment but also not needlessly drag late when students are eager to explore Princeton.</p><p>Outdoor Action, Community Action, and Dialogue and Difference in Action are vital components of our introduction to this University. They foster a sense of community and provide students with immediate friendships and connections. The Board largely approves of Princeton’s implementation of these programs, save for a few aspects that could be improved upon. The limits on OA spots diminish a sense of “challenge by choice,” cell phones should be prohibited across all pre-orientation trips, and the programming when students return to campus Friday night should be brief and uniform across trips. With these changes, the trips will be able to fully live up to their potential as immersive, enjoyable first experiences at Princeton.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Quality Over Quantity: Invite One Lawnparties Headliner a Year</title><dc:creator>Allison Berger</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 01:24:35 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.princetoneditorials.com/edit/2017/9/21/quality-over-quantity-invite-one-lawnparties-headliner-for-the-spring</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59b96337be42d6f8491657db:59b9693ef9a61e8fc5371ed5:59c465f00abd047d7f2adcb8</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday, Princeton held its Fall Lawnparties, featuring Tinashe, Awkwafina, and widespread student enjoyment. The Princeton Editorial Board commends the Undergraduate Student Government (USG), in particular the Social Committee, for its hard work and creativity in continuing to make Lawnparties a highlight of the Princeton calendar. Food trucks with delicious food lined Prospect Avenue, and beverage stations helped students rehydrate and stay safe throughout the day. Logistics such as wristband and ticket pickup also ran smoothly. And the individual eating clubs deserve recognition for the enjoyable performances they hosted on their lawns, open to all. For underclassmen in particular, these performances offered a great opportunity to visit and explore eating clubs with which they may not have interacted before.</p><p>Yet, as in previous years, the day was a long one: many students met friends for brunch or dorm parties as early as 10 AM, while the headliner Tinashe did not take the stage at Quadrangle Club until after 4 PM. As a result, many students did not attend the headliner event, whether due to being tired from a long day or from being unfamiliar with the performer.</p><p>To address this recurring Lawnparties challenge, the Board proposes that USG, rather than inviting a headliner for Fall Lawnparties, consolidate its annual funds such that more money can be spent to host a better-known headliner for Spring Lawnparties. We believe this proposal would improve the overall Lawnparties experience. It would maintain other enjoyable aspects of Fall Lawnparties, such as the food and eating club acts, while greatly improving Spring Lawnparties by including a more popular main act that a larger budget would facilitate. As a further improvement to Spring Lawnparties, we also urge USG to encourage the opening and headlining acts to better coordinate to shorten what is often a long waiting period between the two performances. &nbsp;</p><p>USG works with the individual eating clubs to organize Lawnparties twice a year. Most eating clubs hire a musical act and open their lawns for all students to watch the performances, dance, and socialize. These performances are earlier in the day and very well-attended. Following the acts at the individual clubs, USG organizes a large scale performance by two artists in Quad’s backyard. While this main performance should be the highlight of Lawnparties, students are often disappointed when the performers are artists they did not previously know. The USG Social Committee has done a commendable job soliciting student suggestions for performers, as well as input on the music genres students like most, in order to invite the best performers possible. Yet there is only so much that can be done with a limited budget.</p><p>Comparing Princeton’s Lawnparties budget to budgets for similar events at our peer colleges highlights the budgetary challenges the Social Committee faces. <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2016/02/usg-discusses-lawnparties-budget-wellness">During the 2015-2016 academic year,</a> USG spent a total of $161,000 on Lawnparties: $79,000 in the fall and $82,000 in the spring. By contrast, <a href="http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/04/logistics-behind-securing-spec-spring-fling-headliner">the University of Pennsylvania spent</a> $185,000 for its 2017 Spring Fling and <a href="https://www.ycc.yale.edu/budget/">Yale University spent</a> $298,633 for its 2017 Spring Fling. These higher budgets have enabled UPenn and Yale to bring arguably more well-known headliners to campus over the past several years: <a href="http://www.34st.com/article/2017/03/spring-fling-2017">at UPenn,</a> DJ Zedd in 2017 and Chance the Rapper in 2016 and <a href="http://yalespringfling.org/lineup">at Yale,</a> JoJo in 2017 and Janelle Monáe in 2016. Princeton should follow UPenn and Yale’s model and consolidate its budget to host one main act in the spring, while continuing to work with the eating clubs to support Fall Lawnparties. Because so many students already only attend Lawnparties early in the day for the individual club performances and food trucks, Fall Lawnparties would largely be just as fun without a headliner. Then students would have much to look forward to throughout the year for an exciting headliner at Spring Lawnparties.</p><p>Additionally, to improve students’ experience at the main act in the spring, the Board suggests that USG encourage the opening and headline performers to better coordinate to shorten the waiting period between their performances. In recent years, there has sometimes been a long wait between the opener and headliner that has left tired Princetonians crowded in Quad’s backyard or deciding to leave before the headliner performs. We recognize USG may have less influence over the performance logistics, but believe Princetonians would welcome any efforts by USG to the extent it can work with the artists to make the main act a more cohesive performance.</p><p>We believe these two suggestions of organizing Fall Lawnparties without a headliner such that Spring Lawnparties could host a more expensive, well-known headliner, as well as working with artists to shorten the wait time for the spring main act, would generate more campus enthusiasm about Lawnparties, encourage higher turnout for the main act in the spring, and increase overall performance quality. Princeton students are incredibly lucky to have a USG Social Committee that organizes not one, but two all-campus music festivals, as well as smaller social events throughout the year. We believe the already fun and uniquely ‘Princeton’ tradition of Lawnparties could be made even better by implementing our suggestions, and we urge USG to do so.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Anti-Pluralism at The Daily Princetonian and Announcing a New, Independent Editorial Board</title><category>september</category><category>2017</category><dc:creator>Allison Berger</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2017 00:24:24 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.princetoneditorials.com/edit/2017/9/14/anti-pluralism-at-the-daily-princetonian-and-announcing-a-new-independent-editorial-board</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59b96337be42d6f8491657db:59b9693ef9a61e8fc5371ed5:59bb19a38a02c7f27533a248</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, Daily Princetonian Editor-in-Chief Sarah Sakha announced in a <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2017/09/letter-from-the-editor-the-editorial-board?_h=458da4e5-b283-443c-922b-598184b3b5a1">Letter from the Editor</a> that the ‘Prince’ Editorial Board would be abolished and replaced with a group -- composed of senior ‘Prince’ editors from the Managing Board and select students -- that would publish opinions on certain issues “when exercising an institutional voice is appropriate.” Until last week, the Editorial Board wrote biweekly unsigned editorials on a variety of campus issues. Ms. Sakha’s letter does not explain the rationale for the change, aside from noting that the new structure will more closely resemble the Editorial Board’s previous structure, which had been in place until 2005. It is clear to us that this change was made because the Editorial Board published some editorials that expressed viewpoints contrary to the personal political opinions of the ‘Prince’ Editor-in-Chief and many of the senior editors. Unfortunately, instead of continuing open discourse, the decision was made to silence our voices.</p><p>If the ‘Prince’s’ decision to dissolve the Board were considered absent other factors, there might be no reason for alarm. Neither the new nor old structures of the Editorial Board are inherently flawed, and although Ms. Sakha claimed otherwise in her letter abolishing the Board, there is no “traditional model” for editorial board structures. The Wall Street Journal’s Board includes opinion writers who write under their personal bylines, whereas those who write New York Times editorials do not write under their own bylines and specialize in only writing editorials, a structure similar to that of the former ‘Prince’ Editorial Board. Yet the highly irregular process by which the Managing Board undertook the reorganization as well as the past political disagreements between the Editorial and Managing Boards underscore that this was a decision to censor perspectives with which senior editors disagree.</p><p>The ‘Prince’s’ decision to abolish the Editorial Board in the middle of the calendar year is a radical departure from historic procedure. Each December during ‘Prince’ elections, Editor-in-Chief candidates present their platforms for the paper which staff members debate extensively. The winning candidate then defines the policies and organizational setup for the paper in a contract to which the Managing Board and Trustees jointly agree, and these policies stay broadly intact during the Editor-in-Chief’s tenure. While the paper may thus change from year to year, it is unprecedented to fundamentally alter an entire section halfway through the year, as was done here. Moreover, if the Managing Board’s decision were motivated by a desire to improve the quality of editorials or the functioning of the section, it could easily have solicited input from existing members of the Editorial Board. Instead, members of the Editorial Board were alerted one hour before the public announcement. Even the co-chairs of the Editorial Board were informed of the decision only two days prior to the public announcement, during a meeting at which the change was presented as final with no opportunity for discussion or redress.</p><p>This is not the decision-making process of a Managing Board that is carefully considering ways to improve the newspaper. Rather, the catalyst for the change in the Editorial Board’s structure was a series of editorials that did not align with the personal political convictions of the Editor-in-Chief and other senior editors. &nbsp;</p><p>The first attempt to silence the Editorial Board occurred in October 2016, when the previous Editor-in-Chief sought to block publication of <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2016/10/yes-all-womens-center">an editorial on the Women*s Center</a>. While it was eventually published following much debate and some revision by the previous Editor-in-Chief, such interference with the Board’s independence had never occurred in institutional memory. In an email to the Board, the reason given for this unprecedented assertion that “this particular editorial should not run” was that “more than half of the editors on the masthead...feels uncomfortable having the editorial published on [sic] the Prince.” The previous Editor-in-Chief wrote that her “standard for deciding whether an editorial (or any other article) should be published is simple and clear; whether it adequately represents the viewpoint of the Daily Princetonian as a whole and whether it reflects the values we stand for.” This is a disturbing argument for an ostensibly neutral campus newspaper to impose a values-based vetting standard and to decline to publish an editorial or even an article that does not reflect the personal views of the paper’s senior editors.</p><p>Soon after in December 2016 came the elections for the next, and current, Editor-in-Chief. In her campaign platform, Ms. Sakha expressed support for maintaining the Editorial Board. The only change suggested at that time was introducing a short statement clarifying that Editorial Board pieces were not the official opinion of the ‘Prince,’ a change the Board quickly adopted. Still, when the Board continued producing opinions that conflicted with the personal convictions of senior editors, a number of them would often post on their personal Facebook accounts emphasizing, in an apparent attempt to undermine the credibility of the Board’s arguments, that the Editorial Board did not represent the official opinion of the ‘Prince’ and suggesting their personal disagreement with the editorials. This culminated in Tuesday’s unilateral decision to abolish the Editorial Board.</p><p class="text-align-center">---</p><p>In his remarks to the Class of 2021 during Opening Exercises, President Eisgruber eloquently spoke of his refusal to take an official University stance on the Charlottesville controversy: “It is, however, neither my role nor that of the University to prescribe how you should react to this controversy or others. It is rather my role and the role of the University to encourage you to think deeply about what these events mean for this country and its core values, and to encourage you to find ways to participate constructively in the national dialogue they have generated.”</p><p>As the campus newspaper of record, the ‘Prince’s’ functions parallel those of the University as a whole, including a responsibility to be a neutral platform for pluralistic dialogue. That the Managing Board’s decision was apparently motivated by political reasons makes us skeptical that the newspaper will provide such a neutral platform for debate. As all those who try to enforce an ideology eventually find out, ideas cannot be suppressed.</p><p>Thus we proudly introduce the <a href="https://www.princetoneditorials.com/">Princeton Editorial Board</a>. The Board includes most of the members of the former ‘Prince’ Editorial Board and will function with the same procedures as did the past Editorial Board, but with pieces published on our own website. We believe this structure provides a unique opportunity for campus discourse that is worthwhile to continue. Due to the demanding time commitment necessary to produce a daily newspaper, being a senior editor at the ‘Prince’ is usually a student’s primary extracurricular activity. By contrast, our Board includes varsity athletes, singers, debaters, and other students from a diverse range of campus backgrounds. Having a membership composed of a representative cross section of campus experiences was one of the former Editorial Board’s greatest strengths as we commented on a range of campus issues, from campus sustainability to eating clubs to the departmental advising experience. Notably, a number of our recommendations have been implemented by the University. Most recently, this fall the University began offering meals for student leaders with early move-in; in a <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com:8080/article/2015/09/editorial-reform-start-of-school-meal-plans">September 2015 editorial</a>, the Board called on the University to do precisely that. We look forward to continuing these important contributions to campus life in our new form.</p><p>We invite all students <a href="https://www.princetoneditorials.com/subscribe/">to apply</a>. In our application process as well in the writing of future editorials, ideas will be evaluated based on how well they are argued, not the conclusions they reach. The Board will continue to publish dissents from the majority, enabling a diverse set of views to be heard. We hope that eventually, The Daily Princetonian will follow suit.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
